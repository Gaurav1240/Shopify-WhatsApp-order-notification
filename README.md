# Shopify-WhatsApp-order-notification


To send Shopify order data to WhatsApp as orders come in, you can use the following steps:

Set up a webhook in your Shopify store to notify your application when a new order is created. You can do this by going to your Shopify admin panel, navigating to "Settings" > "Notifications" > "Webhooks" and creating a new webhook with the following information:
URL: The URL of your application that will receive the webhook.
Format: JSON.
Events: Select "Order creation" under the "Order" section.
In your application, receive the webhook from Shopify and extract the relevant order data. You can use any programming language or framework to do this.

Use a WhatsApp API provider to send a message to your desired recipient(s) with the order data. Some popular WhatsApp API providers include Twilio, Nexmo, and WhatsApp Business API.

Format the order data in a readable and concise way for the recipient(s). You can use a templating engine or library to make this process easier.

Send the message using the WhatsApp API provider's SDK or API.
